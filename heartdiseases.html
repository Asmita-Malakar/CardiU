    <h1>Heart Diseases</h1>

    <h3>Atherosclerosis</h3>

    <p>One type of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis. 
       Atherosclerosis is a medical condition in which plaque builds up on the walls of an artery. 
       The plaque can stop blood from flowing, which results in the arteries narrowing, and it can burst, producing a blood clot. 
       If a blood clot breaks, it can cause a heart attack or a stroke. 
       The plaque is made of several components, including fats, cholesterol, and other substances. 
       If atherosclerosis is in the arteries of the heart, a common symptom is angina (chest pain). 
       Symptoms of atherosclerosis in the brain include sudden numbness or weakness in the arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, and drooping muscles in the face. 
       Signs of atherosclerosis in the arteries of the arms and legs are claudication or decreased blood pressure in an affected limb. 
       Although atherosclerosis is often a consequence of arteries hardening over many years, other factors can increase the risk of developing the disease, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, high levels of C-reactive protein, diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea, smoking, family history, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet.

    <h3>Congenital Heart Defects</h3>

    <p>Congenital heart defects are another kind of cardiovascular disease. 
       A congenital heart defect is an abnormality in the heartâ€™s structure. 
       Congenital heart defects can be mild, not requiring treatment. 
       Signs of these defects are not always apparent; however, if they occur, the child may experience shortness of breath, easily tire, or faint during physical activity or have swelling in his or her hands, ankles, or feet. 
       Sometimes congenital heart defects are serious, so physicians will need to perform multiple surgeries throughout the child's life to help him or her recover. 
       Symptoms of moderate to severe congenital heart defects include cyanosis, rapid breathing, swelling in the legs, abdomen, or areas around the eyes, and shortness of breath during feedings, which leads to minimal weight gain. 
       Congenital heart defects start developing during gestation, in the first six weeks of pregnancy, when the heart and the major blood vessels accompanying it form and the heart begins to beat. 
       The causes of these defects are unknown, but scientists believe genetics, medical conditions, medications, and environmental factors may contribute. 
       There are many types of congenital heart defects, and some common ones include ventricular septal defects (VSDs), atrial septal defects (ASDs), tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary valve stenosis, and patent ductus arterioles (PDA). 
       A ventricular septal defect is a gap in the septum of the heart. The hole causes blood to pass from the left to the right side of the heart. After the blood receives oxygen, it is sent to the lungs instead of to the body. 
       As a result, the heart has to pump harder to make up for the lack of oxygenated blood throughout the body. 
       Small ventricular septal defects are often not concerning and may close without intervention. 
       Medium to large-sized VSDs sometimes require surgery so the heart can function normally. 
       Tetralogy of Fallot occurs when a baby is born with four heart defects. 
       In conjunction, these defects cause poorly oxygenated blood to travel from the heart to the body. 
       Children with tetralogy of Fallot typically have blue-tinted skin because their blood does not contain adequate oxygen. 
       Children diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot require surgery but are otherwise healthy. 
       However, they need continuous treatment and may not be able to do certain forms of exercise.
